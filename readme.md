Image Loader
============

Not the prettiest name but this plugin aims to solve the following problems when it comes to loading iamges via javascript

* Loads a 'desired' image into a container or a 'default' image if it isn't found
* provides HTML for displaying a 'preload' overlay whilst the image downloads
* Hides images' ugly state whilst downloading
